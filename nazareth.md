# Nazareth Programme

LOCATION AND DIRECTIONS

Founders & Coders Nazareth is based at the Nazareth Cultural & Tourism Association, inside the Khan El Basha Building, across from the Basilica of the Annunciation.

HOURS

Our Nazareth programme runs Monday through Friday from 10 AM to 7 PM.

DATES

We run three programmes a year, starting in February, June, and October.

ELIGIBILITY

If you are over the age of 18 and can legally enter Israel, you are eligible to apply for our Nazareth programme. 

We welcome international applicants who commit to spending three months in Nazareth and three months in either London or Nazareth. Please note that students coming from outside Israel will not receive any financial support during the programme.

Founders & Coders has no academic requirements. We find that successful students are self-motivated, prepared to work long hours, and committed to collaborative working. Coding also requires a deep curiosity about how things work and a certain stubbornness in the face of repeated failure.

ACCOMMODATION

We expect local students to secure their own accommodation for the duration of the six month programme.

We will help international students find affordable accommodations in Nazareth, in a shared flat or with a host family. International students can expect to spend around Â£400 on monthly rent. Food prices are similar to those in the UK and Europe.

STIPENDS

At this time, we do not offer financial support to local or international students.

We are actively exploring ways to provide a modest living stipend to local students for the duration of the six-month programme. 

SECURITY
